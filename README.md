## About the Project

The workout tracker allows the user to input resistance or cardio activities, then view their past exercises on a fitness tracker dashboard.

## Getting Started

Upon site render, the fitness tracker will allow for the user to create a new workout, view the dashboard or even pick up where they might have left off with a previous workout.

When the user inputs a new workout, they will be given the option of cardio or resistance in a drop down box. Once a selection is made the appropriate inputs will render below and allow the user to give quantitative data that will be saved in a database and used to give visual aids in the fitness tracker dashboard.

## Usage

Open the app to record exercises and view past exercises in the fitness tracker dashboard.
